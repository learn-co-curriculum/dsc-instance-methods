    "Now that you know what classes and instances are, we can talk about instance methods. Instance methods are almost the same as regular functions in Python. The key difference is that an instance method is defined inside of a class and bound to instance objects of that class. Instance methods can be thought of as an attribute of an instance object. The difference between an instance method and another attribute of an instance is that instance methods are *callable*, meaning they execute a block of code. This may seem a bit confusing, but try to think about instance methods as functions defined in a class that are really just attributes of an instance object from that class."
